## Ai-Xray-Analyzer-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN
This project presents an AI-powered solution for detecting bone fractures from X-ray images using deep learning. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system classifies uploaded X-ray images as either fractured or normal, providing quick and accurate assistance to radiologists and patients.
A 3D visualisation of the fractured bone enhances user understanding of the diagnosis.

### ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bone-fracture-detector.git
cd bone-fracture-detector
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download or Place the Model Weights**
   Ensure your trained PyTorch model (`boneFrac.pt`) is placed in the correct path and update it in the code:

```python
model = torch.load('path/to/boneFrac.pt')
```

4. **Run the App**

```bash
python app.py
```
