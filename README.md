# Ai-Xray-Analyzer-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN
This project presents an AI-powered solution for detecting bone fractures from X-ray images using deep learning. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system classifies uploaded X-ray images as either fractured or normal, providing quick and accurate assistance to radiologists and patients.
A 3D visualisation of the fractured bone enhances user understanding of the diagnosis.
